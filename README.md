# Slip detection data generator

This repository contains a program for slip data generation of variety of objects stored in .obj files, the slip data contains the tactile images and slip value as 0 and 1, which represents if slip has occured or not. Currently it is implemented to use EGAD dataset but can be modified for variety of datasets. 

## Dependencies
* Ubuntu 20.04
* docker 20.10.07
* docker-compose version 5.0.3
* Refer requirements.txt for the libraries used in the docker container

## Getting started
* Ensure that above mentioned dependencies are met
* Download egad dataset, copy model0.urdf to the folder containing egad dataset folder containing the .obj files
* edit docker-compose.yml :-
  1. Edit the volume mounts to point to the egad data folder and the folder where tactile images are saved 
  2. uncomment command to run create_id_log.py and comment the command to run multiThreading.py, this will reset the id_log generated during previous data_generation.
* Build docker image and run docker container
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
* edit docker-compose.yml :-
  1. uncomment command to run multiThreading.py and comment the command to run create_id_log.py, this will start the data generation using multiple treads.

* The number of threads and number of objects generated by each thread can be changed by editing taxim_setup/multiThreading.py
* run the code
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## The file structure
* The taxim_setup folder containes the multThreading.py, create_id_log.py and slip_data_generation.py
* taxim_test contains the copy of taxim repoitory and packages required by taxim
